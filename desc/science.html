						<p>Science is a very vast field, so as you'd expect UIL Science covers a lot of things. 20 questions are 
						biology, which cover a variety of concepts introduced in AP Biology as well as more "wildcard" questions 
						that are less commonly known. The chemistry questions cover a lot of material typically from Advanced and 
						AP Chemistry, and apply many of the ideas to solve problems from lattice structure to thermodynamic 
						favorness. Physics covers practically everything from the AP Physics series (1, 2, C Mech, C E&M) and 
						more; this section tests a combination of problems from an annually assigned reading, Mechanics and E&M
						problems, and wrapping it up with linearization. As there's three different subjects covered, contestants 
						can additionally advance from Districts to Regionals to State through an individual topic, placing 1st in 
						the competition for one of the aforementioned subjects.</p>
