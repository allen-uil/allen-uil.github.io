						<p>You remember BIM class from middle school? That class alongside some studying might make you a great 
						fit for this competition. With Microsoft Office ('13, '16, or '19 typically) at your side, constestants 
						have to complete as many of a series of tasks as possible. This may include populating  spreadsheet with 
						data to make a pie chart, importing the data into Access to file a report, and creating a memo to share 
						your boss the pie chart you just created. Either way, this contest is admittingly divide and conquer: 
						doing as much as you know ASAP and then worrying about the rest.</p>
						<ul>
							<li>A packet with Word, Excel, and Access instructions (not necessarily in that order)</li>
							<li>38 minutes in sections</li>
							<ul>
								<li>5 minutes at the start for a typing tiebreaker</li>
								<li>3 minutes once the packet is given to review it and make notes</li>
								<li>30 minutes to actually do the test, with printing having to be completed within this 
								time limit</li>
							</ul>
							<li>Scoring is done according to a rubric</li>
							<li>Each competitor must have their own laptop to use, as well as a printer to print off their 
							results</li>
