						<p>Spelling in UIL is not exactly your typical Spelling Bee anymore, rather having several twists. The 
						first part of the spelling test has proofreading and vocab: identify misspelled words and fill in blanks 
						with the proper choice. The other questions, as well as the tiebreaker, are like a written spelling bee: 
						hear the word and its definition and spell it accordingly. UIL's Word Power changes every year, so make 
						sure to find the latest one on the UIL site.</p>
						<ul>
							<li>100 questions + 20-question tiebreaker</li>
							<li>About 60 minutes</li>
							<li>Scoring:</li>
							<ul>
								<li>+1 for a correct question</li>
								<li><b>No</b> deduction for getting a question wrong</li>
							</ul>
							<li>Part 1 will be 15 minutes of 15 proofreading and 15 vocab questions</li>
							<li>Part 2 will be 70 writing questions, and Part 3 will be 20 questions in similar format (note 
							that neither of these have a set time, so it's really dependent on the meet itself</li>
