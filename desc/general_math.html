						<p>Math in general! If you've seen TMSCA middle school tests, think about it as those with like 20 times 
						as many topics. The first few questions can be solved easily by anyone who has an understanding of basic 
						Algebra I/II, but these questions can quickly advance to AP Calculus BC or AP Statistics information. The 
						trick to these is to answer to the best of your knowledge, and play to your fore. Freshmen without 
						precalculus have beaten seniors to UIL team spots, and sophomores without calculus or stats have topped 
						regional rankings. This test has a wide variety of problems, and it's up to the competitors to strategize 
						skillfully.</p>
						<ul>
							<li>60 questions</li>
							<li>40 minutes</li>
							<li>Scoring:</li>
							<ul>
								<li>+6 for a right answer</li>
								<li>-2 for a wrong answer</li>
								<li><b>No</b> deductions for not answering a question</b></li>
							</ul>
							<li>Ranging from Algebra I/II to BC Calculus and AP Statistics</li>
