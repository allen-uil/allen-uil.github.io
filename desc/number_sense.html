						<p>Gotta go fast gotta go fast gotta go fast gotta go fast...That's pretty much what this is. Number Sense 
						is a test of quickly solving math problems, and even better you don't get to use a calculator or write 
						down work!! All calculations have to be done manually, but of course with such a daunting contest there's a 
						huge load of tricks to guide competitors along the way. Also when you see the number of questions below, 
						don't panic. No one is expecting anyone to solve all 80 <s>except like Jakob but that's not the point</s>
						.</p>
						<ul>
							<li>80 questions</li>
							<li>10 minutes</li>
							<li>Scoring:</li>
							<ul>
								<li>+5 for a right answer</li>
								<li>-4 for a wrong answer</li>
								<li>-4 for skipping a question (not answering a question before the last attempted)</li>
							</ul>
							<li>Only mental math allowed i.e. scratch work or calculators will get you DQed</li>
