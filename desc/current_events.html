						<p>Current Events is a test that quizzes students on their knowledge of events from approximately the 
						past 12 months. The multiple-choice test will ask students to identify aspects of recent news, such as 
						the CEO of a company that may have gained popularity within the past months, and the essay portion will 
						ask students to synthesize information given to them about a recent occurrence, such as the effects of 
						COVID-19 on the modern-day economy.</p>
