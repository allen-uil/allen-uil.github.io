						<p>This page actually has a couple of contests together, but they're pretty similar in competition style 
						and idea. Many of these include being given a series of resources and having to write a paper about them, 
						whether that might be an editorial or a news flash. There's also a few other competitions. Ready Writing 
						is a 2-hour long contest where one is given two quotes and has to write an essay based on one. Copy 
						Editing is another, which is about properly editing a document for any grammatical errors and related 
						things.</p>
