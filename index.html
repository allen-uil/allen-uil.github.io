						<p>Hey y'all! I'm Warith, and I'm a part of Allen's class of 2024. I wanted to make this site as an 
						alternative resource for all things Allen UIL. This should include descriptions of the many competitions 
						offered, our practice schedule, and a mini FAQ below. Hope this helps everyone a lot, and if you have any 
						questions or suggestions you can contact me <a style="color: #000" 
						href="https://warithr621.github.io/media.html"><u>here</u></a>.</p>
						<p>By the way, <a 
							href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1gtCfNwZEVMHwKLcMb1uK-nMaLVpSHp6y?usp=sharing">
							this drive folder</a> should have a couple of past tests available for Calculator, Computer 
							Science, General Math, Number Sense, and Science. You should also join the Discord server for more 
							updates <a href="https://discord.gg/5zWEJhWtud">here</a>.</p>

						<h2>What is Academic UIL?</h2>
						<p>UIL is the University Interscholastic League, founded as two separate competitions before merging under 
						the acronym "UIL" in 1913. It features three primary areas: athletics, arts, and academics. The academic 
						side of this focuses on a variety of competitions for students to show off their expertise, whether that 
						be in STEM, a humanities competition, or even something not necessarily either!</p>
						<p>Allen's been participating in this for a while, and just recently we finished 1st sweepstakes at the 
						2023 State competition (trophy on right), including having 3 1st place teams in the state and having the best 6A spelling team for three years running!</p>
						<br>
						<h2>How do I join?</h2>
						<p>If school just started at the time you're reading this, the UIL info meeting would probably be in late 
						August or early September, most likely at Lowery. If the meeting had already happened, you could try either 
						asking someone who you know is in UIL, or try emailing Mrs. Tuerck at nada.tuerck@allenisd.org</a> 
							for more info on how to join.</p>
						<br>
						<h2>When are competitions?</h2>
						<p>The fall semester is primarily practices, which occur on a weekly basis at either Allen High School 
						or the Lowery Freshman Center. From January through March we start going to practice competitions called 
						<u>UIL Invitationals</u> that occur throughout the DFW complex. Late March introduces the <u>UIL District 
						competition</u>, where we send our best to face off against cities like McKinney, Little Elm, Denton, and 
						Prosper. Those who qualify for <u>UIL Regionals</u> compete in mid-April against many other schools in
						North Texas and around DFW, and the best of the best get to travel to UT Austin for the <u>State</u> 
						competition in early May.</p>
						<br>
						<h2>How are teams for District (and beyond) decided?</h2>
						<p>As I mentioned, we have both practice meetings and interschool competitions throughout the year. As 
						these progress, our coaches work together to pick the best of the best from all our competitors. With 
						some exceptions, each team sent to Districts will typically have <b>6</b> people (exceptions include 3 in Computer 
						Apps), which is different from past years. These teams are typically announced the week after Spring Break, about 2 weeks 
						prior to Districts.</p>
						<p>These people then represent us at our District meet. The top 3 individuals and the top team in each 
						category get the honor of advancing to Regionals, and the same advancement rules apply to get to State. 
						It's even possible to get into multiple teams (even up to 6 different ones!).</p>
						<br>
						<h2>Can I still participate even if I don't think I'm good enough?</h2>
						<p>Whether you think you're good or not, I think you should still try to give this a shot to see how it 
						goes. Everyone, both the best and the worst, all start from a basic block and grow from learning. Even if 
						you're entirely new at a competition, you may later realize that it's pretty interesting and that you even 
						excel at it. Regardless, both the meetings and the competitions are a great way to learn something new, 
						show off your newfound knowledge, and spend a nice Saturday with some friends. Everyone always has room 
						for improvement, and that all starts just by taking the first step to try something.</p>
