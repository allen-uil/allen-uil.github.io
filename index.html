				<h2>Why does this site exist?</h2>

						<p>Hey y'all! I'm Warith, and I'm a part of Allen's class of 2024. At some point I sat down and realized 
						that "wait a minute Allen had that one Google Site from a while ago, didn't it?" I decided to remake it 
						because <b>A)</b> it was kind of out-of-date and <b>B)</b> I made this one so naturally it's better.
						Anywho, feel free to look around and reach out to me if you have any feedback on the site. Â¡Gracias!</p>
						<br>
						<h2>Wait, what's Academic UIL?</h2>
						<p>UIL is the University Interscholastic League, founded as two separate competitions before merging under 
						the acronym "UIL" in 1913. It features three primary areas: athletics, arts, and academics. The academic 
						side of this focuses on a variety of competitions for students to show off their expertise, whether that 
						be in STEM, a humanities competition, or even something not necessarily either!</p>
						<p>Allen's been participating in this for a while, and just recently we finished 2nd sweepstakes at the 
						2022 State competition (trophy on right), including having 2 state champions and having the best 6A
						spelling team for two years running!</p>
						<br>
						<h2>Sounds cool, how do I join?</h2>
						<p>If school just started at the time you're reading this, the UIL info meeting would probably be in late 
						August or early September, most likely at Lowery. If the meeting had already happened, you could try either 
						asking someone who you know is in UIL, or try emailing Ms. Gesh at <a href="dawn.geshwender@allenisd.org">
						dawn.geshwender@allenisd.org</a> for more info on how to join.</p>
						<br>
						<h2>Sweet! But wait, when are competitions?</h2>
						<p>The fall semester is primarily practices, which occur on a weekly basis at either Allen High School 
						or the Lowery Freshman Center. From January through March we start going to practice competitions called 
						<u>UIL Invitationals</u> that occur throughout the DFW complex. Late March introduces the <u>UIL District 
						competition</u>, where we send our best to face off against cities like McKinney, Little Elm, Denton, and 
						Prosper. Those who qualify for <u>UIL Regionals</u> compete in mid-April against many other schools in
						North Texas and around DFW, and the best of the best get to travel to UT Austin for the <u>State</u> 
						competition in early May.</p>
						<br>
						<h2>"Our best"? How are those decided?</h2>
						<p>As I mentioned, we have both practice meetings and interschool competitions throughout the year. As 
						these progress, our coaches work together to pick the best of the best from all our competitors. With 
						some exceptions, each team sent to Districts will typically have 4 people (Computer Apps has 3 and Science 
						has 6 for example). These teams are typically announced the week after Spring Break, about 2 weeks prior 
						to Districts.</p>
						<p>These people then represent us at our District meet. The top 3 individuals and the top team in each 
						category get the honor of advancing to Regionals, and the same advancement rules apply to get to State. 
						If you're wondering, it is possible to get into multiple teams (the guy who made this website is literally 
						in 6 of them for example).</p>
						<br>
						<h2>Wait what if I want to participate but I don't think I'm that good...?</h2>
						<p>Whether you think you're good or not, I think you should still try to give this a shot to see how it 
						goes. Everyone, both the best and the worst, all start from a basic block and grow from learning. Even if 
						you're entirely new at a competition, you may later realize that it's pretty interesting and that you even 
						excel at it. Regardless, both the meetings and the competitions are a great way to learn something new, 
						show off your newfound knowledge, and spend a ncie Saturday with some friends. Everyone always has room 
						for improvement, and that all starts just by taking the first step to try something <s>and also listen 
						to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoq8B8ThgEM">Tujh</a></s>.</p>
